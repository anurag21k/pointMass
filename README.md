# pointMass
pointMass pybullet RL environment for simple experiments

It is a openAI gym goal based environment, and has modifiable difficulty. The easiest environment is a 2D self navigation task. Further levels of difficulty involve a modifiable number of objects which must be pushed to goal locations. 

E.g, the gold point mass must push the green block to it's goal location, the green sphere.
